# CKA Practice Lab â€” CRD Exploration & kubectl explain

This lab helps you practice working with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and using kubectl explain - essential CKA exam skills.

## Scenario

cert-manager has been installed in the cluster with several CRDs. Your tasks are to:

1. Create a list of all cert-manager CRDs and save it to `/root/resources.yaml`
2. Extract documentation for the `subject` field of the Certificate Custom Resource and save it to `/root/subject.yaml`
3. Use any output format that kubectl supports

## Quick Start

**Killercoda (recommended):**
```

```

**Local cluster:**
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vj2201/killercoda-scenarios/main/cert-manager-lab/setup.sh | bash
```

Then follow the steps in the scenario.
