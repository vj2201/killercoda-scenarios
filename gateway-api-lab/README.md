CKA Practice Lab — Migrate Ingress to Gateway API

This lab helps you practice migrating an existing Ingress (`web`) to the Kubernetes Gateway API while preserving HTTPS and routing rules.

Usage
- Killercoda: open https://killercoda.com/vj2201/scenario/gateway-api-lab and follow the commands in step 1 to create the baseline, then complete steps 2–4.
- Local cluster: copy/paste the manifest block from `gateway-api-lab/step1.md` to create the baseline, then apply the Gateway and HTTPRoute from steps 2 and 3.

Cleanup (optional): `bash gateway-api-lab/cleanup.sh`
