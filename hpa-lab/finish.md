# Congratulations! 🎉

You've successfully completed the HPA lab.

## What You Learned
- Creating Horizontal Pod Autoscalers
- Configuring CPU-based autoscaling thresholds
- Setting custom scaling behavior policies

## Key Takeaway
HPA automatically adjusts pod replicas based on resource metrics. Stabilization windows prevent rapid scaling oscillations.

Keep practicing! 🚀
