# Congratulations! 🎉

You've successfully completed the Ingress lab.

## What You Learned
- Creating NodePort Services to expose deployments
- Configuring Ingress resources for HTTP routing
- Testing connectivity with curl

## Key Takeaway
Ingress provides HTTP/HTTPS routing to services based on hostname and path. The Ingress controller reads these rules and routes traffic accordingly.

Keep practicing! 🚀
