<summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint: What is cri-dockerd?</summary>

**cri-dockerd** is a CRI (Container Runtime Interface) adapter for Docker Engine.

- Kubernetes removed built-in Docker support in v1.24
- cri-dockerd provides the CRI interface between Kubernetes and Docker
- Required if you want to use Docker as the container runtime with kubeadm

### Enable and Start the cri-docker Service

Enable the service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable cri-docker.service
```

Start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start cri-docker.service
```

### Verify the Service is Running

```bash
systemctl status cri-docker.service
```

You should see `Active: active (running)`.

Also enable and start the socket:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable cri-docker.socket
sudo systemctl start cri-docker.socket
systemctl status cri-docker.socket
```
