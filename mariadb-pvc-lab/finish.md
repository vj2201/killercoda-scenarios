# Congratulations!

You've successfully completed the Persistent Volume Recovery lab.

## What You Learned
- PersistentVolumes persist data beyond pod lifecycle
- PersistentVolumeClaims bind to PVs based on storageClass and capacity
- Volume mounts connect PVC claims to container mount paths

## Key Takeaway
PVC/PV binding enables stateful applications to survive pod deletions while preserving data.

Keep practicing!
