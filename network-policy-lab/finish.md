# Congratulations! 🎉

You've successfully completed the NetworkPolicy lab.

## What You Learned
- Creating least-permissive NetworkPolicies
- Controlling pod-to-pod communication across namespaces
- Using namespace selectors and port restrictions

## Key Takeaway
NetworkPolicies provide network segmentation. Default deny with explicit allow rules ensures minimum necessary access.

Keep practicing! 🚀
