# Congratulations! 🎉

You've successfully completed the NodePort Service lab.

## What You Learned
- Configuring containerPort in pod specifications
- Creating NodePort Services for external access
- Testing Service connectivity

## Key Takeaway
NodePort Services expose pods on a specific port (30000-32767) on all nodes, making them accessible from outside the cluster.

Keep practicing! 🚀
