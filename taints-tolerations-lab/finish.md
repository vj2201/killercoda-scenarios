# Congratulations! 🎉

You've successfully completed the Taints and Tolerations lab.

## What You Learned
- Adding taints to nodes to control pod placement
- Creating tolerations in pod specs to bypass taints
- Using taints for node reservation strategies

## Key Takeaway
Taints and tolerations work together to ensure pods are scheduled only on appropriate nodes. Taints repel pods, while tolerations allow specific pods to "tolerate" those taints.

Keep practicing! 🚀
