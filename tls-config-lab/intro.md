## Question

There is an existing deployment in the `nginx-static` namespace. The deployment contains a ConfigMap that supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 as well as a Secret for TLS.

There is a service called `nginx-service` in the `nginx-static` namespace that is currently exposing the deployment.

**Task:**

1. Configure the ConfigMap to only support TLSv1.3
2. Add the IP address of the service in `/etc/hosts` and name it `ckaquestion.k8s.local`
3. Verify everything is working using the following commands:
   ```bash
   curl -vk --tls-max 1.2 https://ckaquestion.k8s.local  # should fail
   curl -vk --tlsv1.3 https://ckaquestion.k8s.local      # should work
   ```
